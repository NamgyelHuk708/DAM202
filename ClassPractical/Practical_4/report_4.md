### 2.4 Comprehensive Visualization Analysis

#### **Training History Comparison (Side-by-Side Plots)**

![alt text](assets/historical.png)

The `plot_comparison_history()` function creates two key visualizations:

**Validation Loss Comparison (Left Plot):**
- **GRU (Green Line)**: Starts with significantly higher validation loss but converges rapidly in first few epochs, achieving slightly lower final loss
- **LSTM (Blue Line)**: Begins with much lower validation loss but converges more slowly, stabilizing at slightly higher final loss
- **Convergence Pattern**: Both models stabilize by epoch 10 without overfitting (no upward trending)
- **Key Insight**: GRU demonstrates more efficient training despite higher initial error

**Validation MAE Comparison (Right Plot):**
- **Consistent Trends**: MAE patterns nearly identical to loss plots, confirming learning behavior
- **Performance Evolution**: LSTM superior for first 4 epochs, GRU surpasses from epoch 5 onwards with lower final MAE
- **Stable Training**: Both models converge without major oscillations (GRU shows spike at epoch 2 but remains stable)

#### **Model Evaluation Visualizations**
The `evaluate_model_comprehensive()` function generates multiple diagnostic plots:

![alt text](assets/lstm.png)

**LSTM Time Series Prediction Analysis:**
- **Actual vs Predicted**: Predicted line (orange) captures overall trends but is noticeably smoother, averaging out sharp daily fluctuations rather than predicting them precisely
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Successfully identifies annual seasonality, accurately tracking temperature rises in warmer months and declines in colder months
- **Error Distribution**: Performance varies with temperature - consistently struggles with extremes, under-predicting highest peaks and over-predicting lowest troughs

**LSTM Scatter Plot Analysis:**
- **Linear Correlation**: Tight clustering in strong positive linear pattern around diagonal (R² > 0.92)
- **Minimal Scatter**: Close grouping indicates generally small prediction errors for majority of data points
- **Systematic Bias Detected**: Clear bias pattern - over-prediction at lower temperatures (points above line) and under-prediction at higher temperatures (points below line)


![alt text](assets/gru.png)

**GRU Time Series Prediction Analysis:**
- **Actual vs Predicted**: Close alignment with general trend but predictions significantly smoother, failing to capture high-frequency daily variations
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Successfully captures broad seasonal weather patterns and cyclical temperature changes
- **Error Distribution**: Inconsistent performance across temperature ranges - most significant errors at extremes (under-predicts peaks, over-predicts troughs)

**GRU Scatter Plot Analysis:**
- **Linear Correlation**: Strong positive linear relationship with tight clustering around diagonal reference line
- **Minimal Scatter**: Close grouping around perfect prediction line indicates small error magnitudes for most data points
- **Systematic Bias Present**: Similar bias pattern to LSTM - over-prediction at lower temperatures, under-prediction at higher temperatures


#### **Sequence Length Analysis (4-Panel Comprehensive View)**

![alt text](assets/compare.png)

The `analyze_sequence_results()` function creates the most insightful visualization:

**Panel 1 - RMSE vs Sequence Length:**
- **LSTM Curve (Blue)**: Distinct U-shaped pattern - decreases from 7 to 30 days (optimal point), then increases for 45-60 days
- **GRU Curve (Orange)**: Highly volatile - very high error at 7 days, improves at 14 days, spikes at 45 days, optimal at 60 days
- **Crossover Analysis**: LSTM outperforms GRU at 14, 21, 30, and 45 days; GRU only superior at 60 days
- **Key Finding**: LSTM favors medium sequences (30 days), GRU requires long sequences (60 days)

**Panel 2 - R² Score Trends:**
- **LSTM Performance**: Stable and consistent across all lengths, peaks at 30 days (~0.949)
- **GRU Performance**: More erratic, notably lower at 7 and 45 days, peaks at 60 days (~0.948)
- **Consistency Advantage**: LSTM demonstrates superior stability across sequence lengths

**Panel 3 - Temperature Accuracy (±2°C):**
- **LSTM Reliability**: Consistently >93.5% accuracy across all lengths, peaks at 30 days
- **GRU Volatility**: Poor at 7 days (<90%), peaks at 21 days, dips at 45 days, best at 60 days (>95%)
- **Practical Insight**: LSTM more reliable across wider range of sequences despite GRU's peak performance

**Panel 4 - Bar Chart Comparison:**
- **Visual Evidence**: Clear RMSE comparison showing LSTM (blue bars) superior at 14-45 day sequences
- **Pattern Recognition**: GRU's single point of superiority at 60 days clearly visible
- **Deployment Decision**: Chart facilitates easy identification of optimal configurations

#### **Critical Systematic Bias Analysis**
Both LSTM and GRU models exhibit identical systematic bias patterns confirmed through scatter plot analysis:

**Temperature Range Bias:**
- **Low Temperatures**: Tendency for over-prediction (predicted values higher than actual)
- **High Temperatures**: Tendency for under-prediction (predicted values lower than actual)  
- **Mid-Range**: Most accurate predictions in middle temperature range

**Model Behavior Implications:**
- **Conservative Predictions**: Both models biased toward mean temperature, less likely to predict extremes
- **Extreme Event Handling**: Poor performance during unusual heat waves or cold snaps
- **Smoothing Effect**: Better at capturing long-term trends rather than precise daily variations

**Practical Consequences:**
- **Weather Warnings**: Models may fail to predict critical temperature thresholds, impacting alert reliability
- **Agricultural Applications**: Misjudging temperature extremes could lead to incorrect frost/heat stress assessments
- **Model Reliability**: High average accuracy but reduced reliability for extreme event applications

**Panel 2 - R² Score Trends:**
- **Both Models**: Achieve R² > 0.93 across most sequence lengths
- **Peak Performance**: LSTM at 30 days (0.9484), GRU at 60 days (0.9486)
- **Consistency**: LSTM more stable across medium sequences (14-45 days)

**Panel 3 - Temperature Accuracy (±2°C):**
- **LSTM Advantage**: Consistently >91% accuracy across all sequence lengths
- **GRU Peak**: Best performance at 60 days (95.50% accuracy)
- **Practical Insight**: Both models exceed 90% accuracy threshold for deployment

**Panel 4 - Bar Chart Comparison:**
